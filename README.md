# Project Overview

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This document is your go-to guide for the awesome project we've been working on. Let's dive right in!

## Introduction
So, what's this project all about? Well, we've built a slick task management system where you can add, delete, update task statuses, and view them. Plus, there's a cool filtering feature on the homepage to sort tasks by status. We've used Vue 3 with TypeScript, Pinia, and Bootstrap-vue-next to make it all happen. Oh, and we've sprinkled in some i18n magic for multiple language support.

## Features Implemented
1. **CRUD Operations:**
   - You can add task, delete task, view task list and one task and update task status.
   - Each task has its own page for your viewing pleasure.

2. **Filtering:**
   - Check out the homepage â€“ we've added a nifty filter to sort tasks by status.

3. **Localization:**
   - Made the app multilingual using the i18n library.

4. **UI and Responsive Design:**
   - Used Bootstrap-vue-next to make things look good and work smoothly.
   - Okay, we admit, there's room for even more UI magic, but we've got the basics covered.

5. **Full Stack Fun:**
   - This is a Full Stack marvel! We've got Laravel on the backend, Jetstream, and other goodies.

6. **Code Quality:**
   - We care about code quality, so we've brought in ESLint to keep things tidy.
   - Also, Vue Prettier is on board to maintain that consistent code format.
   - Used storage for user, task, status and authentication.

7. **Version Control:**
   - Kept things organized with clear and concise Git messages. It's all about that version control love!

## Areas for Improvement
- We had to rush a bit, so the UI could use some more love. Future versions, watch out for even cooler designs!
- Yeah, there are a couple of bugs on the logout, login, and register pages. Bootstrap fields are playing hide and seek. We'll fix that soon!
